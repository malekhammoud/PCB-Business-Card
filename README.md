# PCB Business Card Project

This project documents the process of designing and manufacturing a custom PCB business card using EasyEDA and the Hack Club OnBoard grant.

## ðŸ›  Overview

This business card:
- Transmits a URL via NFC
- Lights up using harvested energy from a phone

## Components Used

| Component                     | Description                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| NT3H2111W0FHKH NFC Chip      | Handles NFC + energy harvesting              |
| 2V LED (e.g., C2296)         | Lights up using harvested energy             |
| 47Î© Resistor                 | Current-limiting resistor for the LED        |
| 220nF Capacitor              | Smoothing capacitor for energy output        |
| 25x48mm NFC Antenna (trace) | PCB trace to act as the NFC antenna          |

## PCB Layout

Converted schematic to PCB:
- Board Size: `88.9mm x 50.8mm`, round rectangular, 4mm radius
- 2-layer PCB (TopLayer red, BottomLayer blue)
- Components placed to avoid overlapping traces
- Auto-router + manual routing for final connections
- Custom silkscreen added for personal branding
